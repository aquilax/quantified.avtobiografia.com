After listening to [Homo Deus: A Brief History of
Tomorrow](http://amzn.to/2ulgPfh) , decided to automate my data reporting even
more and make most of the data I'm collecting public.


My rationale is that Google, FitBit, Samsung, Gyroscope and Xiaomi already have
most of that data, and it's not fair to keep it closed only in their ecosystems.
