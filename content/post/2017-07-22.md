After listening to [Homo Deus: A Brief History of
Tomorrow](http://amzn.to/2ulgPfh), decided to automate my data reporting even
more and make most of the data I'm collecting public.
<!--more-->

My rationale is that [Google](https://fit.google.com/),
[FitBit](https://www.fitbit.com/), [Samsung](https://shealth.samsung.com/),
[Gyroscope](https://gyrosco.pe/aquilax/) and
[Xiaomi](http://www.mi.com/en/miband2/) already have
most of that data, and it's not fair to keep it closed only in their ecosystems.
