After listening to [Homo Deus: A Brief History of
Tomorrow](http://amzn.to/2ulgPfh), decided to automate my data reporting even
more and make most of the data I'm collecting public.
<!--more-->

My rationale is that [Google](https://fit.google.com/),
[FitBit](https://www.fitbit.com/), [Samsung](https://shealth.samsung.com/),
[Gyroscope](https://gyrosco.pe/aquilax/) and
[Xiaomi](http://www.mi.com/en/miband2/) already have
most of that data, and it's not fair to keep it closed only in their ecosystems.



Today I am <strong>2 days</strong> old and my weight is <strong>0 kg</strong>. During the day, I consumed <strong>0 kcal</strong> coming from <strong>0 g</strong> fat, <strong>0 g</strong> carbohydrates and <strong>0 g</strong> protein. Managed to do <strong>0 push-ups</strong>, <strong>0 crunches</strong> and walked <strong>0 steps</strong> during the day which is approximately <strong>0 km</strong>.
