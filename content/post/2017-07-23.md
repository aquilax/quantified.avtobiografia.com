Today I worked a bit on making the site more useful. Thanks to the versatility
of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), I was able to add charts relatively easy with
[Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/). They may not be the pretiest but are easy
to set up.


Today I am <strong>1 days</strong> old and my weight is <strong>0 kg</strong>. During the day, I consumed <strong>0 kcal</strong> coming from <strong>0 g</strong> fat, <strong>0 g</strong> carbohydrates and <strong>0 g</strong> protein. Managed to do <strong>0 push-ups</strong>, <strong>0 crunches</strong> and walked <strong>0 steps</strong> during the day which is approximately <strong>0 km</strong>.
